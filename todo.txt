implement "framebuffer shortcuts"

separate "light" objects as new model
	...OR render out "bright parts" only to a framebuffer
add initial bloom support (blur shader)

add fog fx
	include small moving cloud billboards near the ground
	haze lights after a certain distance threshold (replace raw bloom effect?)
	fade out hazed lights after a cetrain threshold
